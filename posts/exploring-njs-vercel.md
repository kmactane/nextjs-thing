title: 'Exploring Next.js and Vercel'
---

I've been exploring Next.js and Vercel lately, and the current area of exploration is that of **deployment**. I'm investigating just how deployments using Vercel work... and then I'll see about hosting and deploying on my own.

In essence: start with the training wheels, and then try without 'em. After all, you never know when you might have to build your own Next.js deployment system - or understand an existing one at a new employer, or something.
